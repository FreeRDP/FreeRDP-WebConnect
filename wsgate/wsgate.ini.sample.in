[acl]
# The entries in this section limit the destination RDP hosts that can be
# connected to.

# The order directive, along with the allow and deny directives, controls a three-pass access
# control system. The first pass processes either all allow or all deny directives, as specified
# by the Order directive. The second pass parses the rest of the directives (deny or allow).
# The third pass applies to all requests which do not match either of the first two.
#
# Note that all allow and deny directives are processed, unlike a typical firewall, where only
# the first match is used. The last match is effective (also unlike a typical firewall).
# Additionally, the order in which lines appear in the configuration files is not significant.
# All allow lines are processed as one group, all deny lines are considered as another,
# and the default state is considered by itself.
#
# Possible values:
# allow,deny
# First, all allow directives are evaluated; at least one must match, or the request is rejected.
# Next, all deny directives are evaluated. If any matches, the request is rejected.
# Last, any requests which do not match an allow or a deny directive are denied by default.
#
# deny,allow
# First, all deny directives are evaluated; if any match, the request is denied unless it also
# matches an allow directive. Any requests which do not match any allow or deny directives
# are permitted.
#
# Default: deny,allow
#order = deny,allow
